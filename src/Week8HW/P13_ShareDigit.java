13. Shared Digit

   Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.
   Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive).
   If one of the numbers is not  within the range, the method should return false.
   The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers,
   such as 2 in 12 and 23;  otherwise, the method should return false.
   EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
        * hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers
        * hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99
        * hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers
        NOTE: The method hasSharedDigit should be defined as public static

18. Sum Calculator

        Write a class with the name SimpleCalculator. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with  names firstNumber and secondNumber both of type double.
        Write the following methods (instance methods):
        ● Method named getFirstNumber without any parameters, it needs to return the value of the  firstNumber field.
        ● Method named getSecondNumber without any parameters, it needs to return the value of  the secondNumber field.
        ● Method named setFirstNumber with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the firstNumber field.
        ● *Method named setSecondNumber with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the  value of the secondNumber field.
        ● Method named getAdditionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of  adding the field values of firstNumber and secondNumber.
        ● Method named getSubtractionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of  subtracting the field values of secondNumber from the firstNumber.
        ● Method named getMultiplicationResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result  of multiplying the field values of firstNumber and secondNumber.
        ● Method named getDivisionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of  dividing the field values of firstNumber by the secondNumber. In case the value of  secondNumber is 0 then return 0.
        TEST EXAMPLE
        TEST CODE: Write the bellow code into main method
        o
        OUTPUT
        add= 9.0
        subtract= 1.0
        multiply= 0.0
        divide= 0.0
        TIPS:
        ● add= 9.0 is printed because 5.0 + 4 is 9.0
        ● subtract= 1.0 is printed because 5.0 - 4 is 1.0
        ● multiply= 0.0 is printed because 5.25 * 0 is 0.0
        ● divide= 0.0 is printed because secondNumber is set to 0
        NOTE: All methods should be defined as public NOT public static.
        NOTE: In total, you have to write 8 methods.
